AI Tools in AI Task Manager
 Overview
 The AI-powered Task Management System integrates AI-based features using OpenAI/Gemini API
 to enhance task automation, prioritization, and real-time decision-making. The AI tools optimize
 workflows and improve productivity for users.
 AI Features Implemented
 1. AI-Powered Task Suggestions- How it works: When a user creates a new task, the system sends a request to the OpenAI/Gemini
 API with the task title and description. AI analyzes the task context and suggests improvements or
 additional subtasks.- Example Use Case:
  User inputs: 'Develop API for user authentication'
  AI suggests:
  - Implement JWT-based authentication
  - Secure password hashing with bcrypt
  - Create middleware for protected routes
 2. AI-Driven Task Prioritization- How it works: AI analyzes task deadlines, user workload, and importance to automatically prioritize
 tasks. Uses machine learning models to predict task urgency.- Example Use Case:
  - High-priority: 'Prepare presentation for investor meeting'
  - Medium-priority: 'Refactor codebase'
  - Low-priority: 'Organize documentation'
 3. AI-Powered Smart Reminders
- How it works: AI detects deadlines and schedules reminders via notifications (Slack, Email,
 Discord). AI adapts reminder frequency based on task urgency and user behavior.- Example Use Case:
  - 'Submit project report by 5 PM' AI sends reminders at 3 PM and 4:30 PM
 4. AI Chatbot for Task Assistance- How it works: AI chatbot integrated into the task management dashboard allows users to ask for
 suggestions, get task summaries, and automate actions.- Example Use Case:
  User: 'Summarize pending tasks'
  AI: 'You have 3 urgent tasks: Complete API development, prepare investor report, and optimize
 database queries'
 Deployment and AI Integration- AI models are hosted on cloud services (OpenAI/Gemini API)- WebSockets and Goroutines are used for real-time AI recommendations- Deployed on cloud platforms (Render, Fly.io, Vercel
